                *EDIT*<br />
                Born and raised in Etobicoke, I am now investing and raising my
                own family here.<br />
                I can`t imagine a better place to live and work.<br />
                From my personal investment experience in residential real
                estate, I have developed a wealth of knowledge. I am able to
                advise my clients in home remodelling, financing and property
                management. I strive to provide more knowlege and more service
                at every oppurtunity.<br />
                Unlike most people who hold a real estate sales licence in the
                GTA, real estate is my full time job. I am able to put in the
                hours needed to provide my clients with the personal and
                professional service they deserve. <br />
